# regression_model_comparison
The two available datasets are **AirFoil** and **BlogFeedBack**. A pipeline including DecisionTreeRegressor model is trained using AirFoil data. BlogFeedBack data was used to initially train the previous pipeline. A more suitable pipeline was developed for this dataset, which included GradientBoostingRegressor model instead. Comparison of results can be seen in **Figures** folder.
